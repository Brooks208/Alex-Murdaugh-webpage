    <p>A Murderer, an Embezzler, a Drug Addict, and an Attorney from a dynasty of lies and deceit… Who is this person?  The diabolical Alex Murdaugh. Alex Murdaugh was perceived by the public as an esteemed attorney, a hammer of the law, however, he wasn’t. What happened with the murder of his wife and youngest son? How was he a financial felon? Incidents? What about the Dynasty? Finally, what was his motive? </p>
    <a href="#top"><h2 id="murder">The Murder of Paul and Maragret</h2></a>
    <p>Alex Murdaugh, on March 3, 2023, was sentenced to 2 consecutive life sentences for the murder of his son Paul, 22, and his wife Margaret, 54. His alleged alibi was that he was visiting his mother, who has Alzheimer's dementia, and his father, who was on his deathbed. His father died three days after the murders of Margaret and Paul. At the murder scene, bio-matter was 15 feet away from Paul and Margaret's remains, including their brains. They were found dead near the dog kennels on their 1770-acre property. “When I came back here, I mean, I pulled up and I could see them, and, you know, I knew something was bad," Alex said. "... I called 911 immediately,” he told investigators. The family shotgun has been theorized to be the murder weapon, and has never been found, many say it was buried with Alex's father that's why it could never be located. Soon into the 6 week court case, his alibi fell through, because his mothers housemaid got the timeline messed up, also cell phone records showed that it couldn’t have been possible to be at his mom’s . Despite all of the evidence that stated otherwise he still maintained his innocence. He was convicted for the murder of Margaret and Paul. He is currently appealing his sentence, which is doubted to go through.</p>

    <a href="#top"><h2 id="finance-crimes">Alex's Financial Crimes</h2></a>
    <p>Alex Murdaugh was not only a murderer he was a financial felon. Alex was convicted of financial crimes in September of 2023. He pleaded guilty to 22 different accounts of these crimes. Some theorize that one of the reasons he murdered his wife and son is because they knew about his embezzlement; however, I believe there has to be more to it. He stole the sum of 6 million dollars, throughout 16 years from 2005-2021. In total, he is spending 27 years in addition to his 2 life sentences for his crimes. “U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel said he sentenced Murdaugh to a harsher punishment than suggested because he stole from “the most needy, vulnerable people,” including a client who became a quadriplegic after a crash, a state trooper who was injured on the job, and a trust fund intended for children whose parents were killed in a wreck.” According to (Collins Jeffery) at AP News. He will need to pay 9 million dollars in restitution. People say he is truly a monster however you must decide that for yourself. </p>
    <a href="#top"><h2 id="the-murdagh-family">Incidents Regarding the Murdaugh Family</h2></a>
    <p>The Murdaugh family has been at the pinnacle of weird occurrences including the death of their housekeeper, the sad drowning of Mallory Beach, and the suspicious death of Stephen Smith. Gloria Satterfield was the housekeeper of the Murdaugh estate for over 2 decades. She helped to raise Paul and Buster, Alex and Maggie’s other son and was essentially their second and more involved mom. She died in 2018 to “what can be described as a trip and fall.” However, Margaret had said that Gloria had some “McDonalds” and the dogs went after her and tripped her the steps into the house. Her death had a great effect on Paul and his well-being. Alex testified,” He started acting out.” Alex also said he was going to give back to her sons from a trust worth 4.5 million However he stole that too. The death certificate of Gloria said she died of natural causes however that wouldn’t be considered a natural death according to South Carolina law. Young Mallory Beach died in a fatal boat crash with Paul and his friends. Allegedly drunken Paul crashed the family boat after going out. He called his grandfather who with Alex cleaned up the scene and went to the hospital where Paul’s friends were being treated and forced himself into the position of their lawyers who made it seem like it wasn’t Paul's fault. Finally, Stephen Smith was found dead on a roadside 2 miles away from the Murdaugh estate. He was a small-town kid in Buster’s class who identified as homosexual. There was great prejudice in that town against the LGBTTQ+  community. Many people think and have theorized that Buster could have somehow been involved with this however there is no evidence to convict anyone. Buster is suing Netflix and other large media companies for defamation because they portrayed a redhead as the culprit. We will never know what more has been around this family however there is too much to think some of these are only coincidences. </p>

    <a href="#top"><h2 id="family-dynasty">The Murduagh Family Dynasty</h2></a>
    <p>The Murdaugh dynasty has had a great presence in the Hampton area for years. Murdaugh’s great-grandfather Randolph Murdaugh Sr. founded Hampton Law from the ground up around 1910. The firm was originally a personal injury-focused firm that had a large impact on the judicial system in the Hampton area. Randolph Sr. was said to have gone against the corrupt bankers and higher-ups of the government to help the “little dogs” and make life easier for the common folk. His time was during the great depression which shows that he had great empathy for people. The Murdaugh dynasty has had a history of being on both sides of the judicial system like a prosecutor or criminal defense lawyer. The family has a history of being perceived as amazing people. This shows some ways people wouldn’t suspect the highly esteemed family for what conspiracies have been appearing around them.    </p>

    <a href="#top"><h2 id="motive">What Was His Motive?</h2></a>
    <p>We have the history of the family, incidents that have surfaced around the family, and what happened with the murders. Finally, what would have been his motive to kill your son and wife? Many theories have surfaced about how he was angry and it was a drunken rage. However, it most likely was premeditated. Many theories have surfaced about busters' involvement and some of them have great defenses and there is a possibility that this could be true. Money That is the large theme involving this case. Alex allegedly conspired with a distant cousin who worked at his law firm and helped him with his embezzling, he helped Alex allegedly create a plan for his life insurance payouts. He was going to kill Maggie (Margaret) and Paul for their life insurance payout and was going to later have the same cousin, shoot himself (Alex) and then Buster could collect all of the life insurance payouts. In this way, all of Alex’s debts from his money laundering and financial crimes would disappear and would be taken from his estate and wouldn’t affect him directly. This way Alex wouldn’t face time in prison and there could be a benefactor. This is why he killed his son and wife for money.</p>
    <a href="#top"><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2></a>
